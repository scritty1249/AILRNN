what you should have done if you were a nazarene to win the war should have been saved the juice and the gypsies and had the work [0.391 - 2.853]
you have the soul have had them work for the benefit of the victory [3.424 - 5.622]
a man if he wanted to liquidate the master that's the logical thing to do if you want to win [6.368 - 6.521]
and we assume that hitler wanted to win but that's not a very intelligent assumption why would you assume that [7.221 - 8.593]
exactly a good guy so why should we assume that he was aiming at the good that he was promoting [9.126 - 10.335]
even in his own terms right the glorious everlasting for third right [10.841 - 11.272]
the rule for a thayers and be  [11.682 - 13.506]
as uncivilization and music because that's the sort of thing he purported to be interested in well [13.886 - 16.045]
so what do you do with the jews and the gipsies well round up fine in slaves and fling [16.875 - 18.493]
tell them you certainly don't devote a substantial proportion [19.187 - 20.778]
your war resources well you're losing to accelerate the rate at which the [21.072 - 22.021]
extermination is taking place because that's a bit counterproductive [22.575 - 23.958]
unless what you're aiming at is the maximum possible may hem in the shortest period of time [24.276 - 25.896]
what happened as the germans started to lose the war in hitler lose faith in his own ability [26.338 - 26.482]
he believed that the germans had betrayed him with weakness [26.621 - 28.046]
he's perfectly willing to accelerate the rate at which germany was losing the war [28.224 - 29.4]
when hitler and his minions had the choice here's the choice you can [29.541 - 29.722]
your unnecessary demolition of people when the dam war [29.907 - 30.045]
then pick it up afterwards for [30.303 - 31.789]
well you're losing you can just accelerate the man even though it's counterproductive like what they  [31.89 - 32.116]
the mahamad so to me there's an old psychoanalytic i think this was derived by you [32.426 - 32.68]
carol someone is doing or why look at that come [32.863 - 33.285]
infer the motivation it produces may him perhaps it was aiming at me  [33.628 - 35.583]
you know you have to use that victim carefully in someone's irritating you [35.771 - 40.088]
maybe it's because you're a table and you should erself out but maybe it's because [40.739 - 40.97]
the claiming an irritating you and that the actual motivation so perhaps not but [41.499 - 43.258]
another tool in your analytical armament so [43.741 - 43.957]
so you see well this is the thing about warfare that so interesting about bayou can [44.437 - 44.898]
attribute it to territory elation attribute it to a war for resources that's what the [45.023 - 46.411]
i would say wretchedly simple minded economists presume [46.751 - 47.496]
fight over scarce resources is like pay we're a little bit more sophisticated than that [47.685 - 50.592]
first of all what resources are you talking about the bloody in it had nothing they live [50.777 - 52.055]
well what did they have snow and seal blubber [52.357 - 53.606]
people can live an unbelievably deprived condition and so [53.948 - 55.952]
the idea that there are natural resources that we fight over because there's a shortage of them is a pretty oversimplified view of human being [56.075 - 57.454]
