# AIRLNN
This is a small, work in progress project of mine written mostly for hobby purposes. Due to time constraints, I wasn't able to procure enough data to train my own models and had to use pre-trained speech recognition and scene detection models.

### Models and Modules Reference

#### TensorFlow (GPU) v2.3.0 - https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/v2.3.0-rc2
#### PySceneDetect - https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect

### Work in progress name
Adopted (not my models) Image Recognition & Language Neural Network
